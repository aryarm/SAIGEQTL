SAIGE-QTL is an R package developed with Rcpp for scalable and accurate expression quantitative trait locus mapping for single-cell studies 

The method
- Model repeat and complex data structure, due to multiple cells per individual and relatedness between individuals 
- Model discrete read counts
- Fast and scalable for large data, test 20k genes, 200 cell types, millions of cells, millions of variants
- Test rare variations. Single-variant test is underpowered
